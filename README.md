# Megaman Exe Chip Project

This project started in 2018 when I found that the aftermarket prices of some battle chips were insane. It started with what I call the dip chips. Chips with dip switches on them that allow you to use ANY chip that was produced, and many that weren't.

It expanded to include the Link Navi chips. These chips can now be set to any level desired.

Then expanded further to produce all the chips that never got a physical release.

All pcbs were made in eagle and can be modified. Use the Blank chips as a base to create other chips not included in this project.

## Chip Pinouts

[The Dip Switch combinations for all chips, and starforce barcodes for reprinting cards can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1beCqi77os6HziWFO5Ia3u95-WQ1cv9IMDcv7cEDRxCU/edit#gid=0) 


## Exe 6 Link Navis

Eeprom used is an Atmel 24C08AN. 

The chip can be programmed cheaply with a tl866 programmer. 

See the excel sheet for what Hex values to modify to change the Navi and its level.
