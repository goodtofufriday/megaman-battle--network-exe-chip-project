# Megaman Exe Chip Project

This project started in 2018 when I found that the aftermarket prices of some battle chips were insane. It started with what I call the dip chips. Chips with dip switches on them that allow you to use ANY chip that was produced, and many that weren't.

It expanded to include the Link Navi chips. These chips can now be set to any level desired.

Then expanded further to produce all the chips that never got a physical release.
