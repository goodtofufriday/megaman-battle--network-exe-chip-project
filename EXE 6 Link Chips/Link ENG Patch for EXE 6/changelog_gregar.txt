v1.0 - All menu text, graphics, chip text, navi names, virus names, area names, BBS text, Crossover Battle 2 text,
chip shop text, chip trader text, mystery data access text, Poem & Humor text, and item names changed/translated.
The first few cutscenes are translated up until after Iris is saved. Most of the text in Asterland is translated 
except for NPCs (excluding Tab and Mr.Famous). Prof. 9's custom e-card marker and no panic music added. The Tornado
chip glitch is fixed, and the name edit limit is expanded to 8 characters. Cheats added for Gregar SP link navis.
Dark chips and BLG chips added (the same cheats from before work as well). The same modded number trader prizes are
added, with the exception of Falzar X, which is now Gregar X. Mail sort options changed. Should be fully compatible 
with my Falzar patch for trading, netbattling etc.

v1.1 - Fully modified into english. It is now identical to the Falzar patch in terms of completion, and two patch
files are included as well with/without the Wii U features.
