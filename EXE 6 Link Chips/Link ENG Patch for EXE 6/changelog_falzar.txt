v1.0 - Initial release

v1.1 - Added 3 new prizes to number trader. Fixed up a text error that occured
during the "Can't open safe" request bbs mission. Removed the obtaining of
DarkThnd after beating Mr.Quiz. Added 5 new dark chips. Reverted all instances
of KillrMan back to EraseMan.

v1.2 - Fixed major bug with wireless adapter netbattles that caused client's chip 
selection screen to display all non-working chips.

v1.3 - Fixed glitch that caused the game to freeze when talking to generic brown 
Navi in Sky Area 1 during GroundMan class. Corrected PMD unlock text displaying
cave speak.

v1.4 - Translated text I missed in Kaizou/Custom screen that appears when Select
is pressed. DblBeast & both Cybeast chips descriptions changed to more closely match the official 
japanese description. Fixed up a few lines of e-Card receive text (check provided
screenshots). Changed every instance of "TheCount" to "Count". Added replaced japanese virus
battler prizes to number trader (AirSpin1 F, AntiDmg R, Geddon L). Added chip images and
icons to the 4 Arm Change chips and Sync Trigger. Fixed range check for "." character, so now 
mugshots don't look like they're still talking when something like "......." appears. All mail
sort options changed to the ones from BN6. Fixed a small spacing glitch in the credits, where the
M and G weren't aligned properly underneath the S. Number trader "OK" and name edit table bracket
alignments are now fixed. Name entry limit has been expanded to 8, and the placeholder character
has been fixed as well. Fixed Tornado chip glitch that caused it to do more damage when used over
an elemental panel, and had a White Capsule applied to it. Fixed glitch where the last 2 tiles of
Cstmzing and Interval graphics would stay on screen randomly. Added a marker that is used with
Prof. 9's custom e-cards, so when the cards are used with my patch, english text is displayed instead
of japanese!

v1.5 - ProtoMan SP can now be fought after clearing the first 25 BBS missions, and pressing select at
the request board. Game crashing bug from previous Tornado chip fix has been corrected. Updated artwork
for BLG chips.

v1.6 - Graveyard 2 cybertree and cybercloud text glitches corrected, and the Undernet 3 door is now translated
properly and opens with a Machine Sword chip.

v1.7 - Polished up the DarkThnd fix from v1.1 that caused the library to crash when checking the 30th entry, and
made DolThdr E appear in the chip order screen without having obtained the chip first.

v1.8 - Two patches are available now, one with and one without the Wii U features for obtaining all secret chips and
10 extra BBS request. Changed up the credits a bit and changed "PuzzlArm" to "PulseArm".
